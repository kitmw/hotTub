Use SSR to switch at AC zero crossings. Thermal capacity of heater higher enough to switch off for entire mains cycles
Will need triac? - no, don't need triac if load is resistive - current will be in phase with voltage

Low frequency PWM - arduino can only do down to 30Hz, need 10Hz if want 10 duty cycle options (0%, 10%, 20% etc)
